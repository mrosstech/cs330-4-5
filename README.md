How do I approach designing software?
    I utilized most of the previous design skills in developing this software.  From UML diagrams to represent the various classes that were needed to identifying functional and non-functional requirements from the class sylabus.  Taking the iterative approach that we did to designing this particular piece of software felt very much like an agile or scrum based methodology where the project was broken down into much smaller pieces that all contributed to the whole.

How do I approach developing programs.
    In examining how I approach developing software, I start with the smallest possible effort that will produce a result that gets me a little bit farther on the path to creating the finished product.
    For example, all 3D objects can be broken down to triangles. To start the class even a triangle wasn't a small enough starting point.  Getting OpenGL setup and working with an IDE is not a trivial
    exercise. I chose that as my starting point, getting a blank OpenGL window that compiled correctly and didn't crash.  After that came the vertexes and triangles that led to more complex shapes,
    custom classes and more.  I believe that this approach will apply to just about any design effort in the future as all software can be broken down into smaller and less complex components that 
    can be tackled one at a time.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    Graphics are a huge part of applications now.  Gone are the days when simply a green screen and some text will work to fully satisfy the requirements of an application.  Being able to successfully work with and apply the OpenGL skills learned in this class will ensure that I can write impactful and successful software in the future. Studying these concepts has sparked my curiosity into all of the aspects of computational graphics that we didn't get to.  I plan to continue working with OpenGL.  As far as professionally, I can see graphics and game programming something that I may be interested in persuing so this foundation helps as something to build on when looking at careers which use much more demanding and computationally complex graphics engines.
